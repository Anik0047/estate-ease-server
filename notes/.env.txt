This string is a MongoDB connection URI, which is used to connect your application to a MongoDB database. Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. DATABASE_URL: This is typically an environment variable used in your application to store the connection string securely.

2. mongodb+srv://: This indicates that you're using the MongoDB connection protocol with SRV (a DNS record) to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

3. anikbrua98:anikbarua98@: These are the username (anikbrua98) and password (anikbarua98) for authenticating with the MongoDB cluster. This is sensitive information and should generally be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager) rather than hard-coded.

4. cluster0.p37ot.mongodb.net/estate?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0:

* cluster0.p37ot.mongodb.net: This is the host of the MongoDB Atlas cluster. It's the address where your database is hosted.
* /estate: This is the name of the database within your cluster that your application will connect to. In this case, the database name is estate.
* retryWrites=true: This option tells MongoDB to retry write operations if they fail due to transient errors.
* w=majority: This write concern option ensures that write operations are acknowledged by the majority of the nodes in the cluster before considering the operation successful.
* appName=Cluster0: This optional parameter specifies an application name that can be used for logging and monitoring purposes in MongoDB.

This connection string allows your application to securely connect to the estate database hosted on a MongoDB Atlas cluster with the specified credentials and options.
